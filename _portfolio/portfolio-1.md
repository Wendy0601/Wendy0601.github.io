title: "Bayesian Network Learning and Inference"
excerpt: " This project related the features to the target and construct a Bayesian Network. The purpose is to classify the target by learning the BN structure. 
* The hill-climing learning algoirhtm is implemented to determine the BN structure;
* the Maximum Likelihood method to optimize the network parameter 
* The target is obtained via the Maximum A Posterior (MAP) inference.
