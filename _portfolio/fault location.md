title: "Real-time Faulted Line Localization and PMU Placement in Power Systems through Convolutional
Neural Networks"
excerpt: " The proposed method is able to  locate the faulted line in the wide-area network with low obervability. The critical point is to 
extract features based on the physical characteristics.  <br/><img src='/images/CNN_4layer_color_new.png'>"
