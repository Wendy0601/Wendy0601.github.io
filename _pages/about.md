Wenting Li is a Scientist at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL). She was a postdoc research associate of Center for Nonlinear Study and Theory-5 Division at LANL from 2020 to 2023. She obtained the Ph.D. degree in  Electrical Computer and System Engineering (ECSE) and Master degree in Applied Mathematics at the [Rensselaer Polytechnics Institute (RPI)](https://www.rpi.edu/) in Dec. 2019.  Her supervisor is Prof. [Meng Wang](https://ecse.rpi.edu/~wang/). Her doctoral thesis is about developing machine/deep learning based algorithms to enhancing power systems monitoring and protection. Before she came to RPI in 2015, she worked as a research assistant in the Wind Farm Research Center (WFRC) at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU)](http://en.sjtu.edu.cn/) under the supervison of [Prof. Xu Cai](http://eei.sjtu.edu.cn/en/Show.aspx?info_id=433&info_lb=329&flag=282). In 2013, she received her B.S. degree in Elcetrical Engineering and Automation from [Harbin Institute of Technology (HIT)](http://en.hit.edu.cn/).
