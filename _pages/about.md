Wenting Li is a PhD candidate in the department of Electrical Computer and System Engineering (ECSE) at the Rensselaer Polytechnics Institute (RPI). Her supervisor is Prof. [Meng Wang](https://ecse.rpi.edu/~wang/). Her thesis is about feature extraction from high-dimentional data and application of deep learning to power grid. Before she came to RPI in 2015, she worked as a research assistant in the Wind Farm Research Center (WFRC) at Shanghai Jiao Tong University under the supervison of Prof. Xu Cai. In 2013, she received her B.S. degree in Elcetrical Engineering from Harbin Institute of Technology (HIT).
