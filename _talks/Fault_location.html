Diverse fault types, fast re-closures, and complicated
transient states after a fault event make real-time fault location
in power grids challenging. Existing localization techniques in
this area rely on simplistic assumptions, such as static loads, or
require much higher sampling rates or total measurement availability.
This paper proposes a faulted line localization method
based on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifier using
bus voltages. Unlike prior data-driven methods, the proposed
classifier is based on features with physical interpretations that
improve the robustness of the location performance. The accuracy
of our CNN based localization tool is demonstrably superior to
other machine learning classifiers in the literature. To further
improve the location performance, a joint phasor measurement
units (PMU) placement strategy is proposed and validated against
other methods. A significant aspect of our methodology is that
under very low observability (7% of buses), the algorithm is still
able to localize the faulted line to a small neighborhood with high
probability. The performance of our scheme is validated through
simulations of faults of various types in the IEEE 39-bus and 68-
bus power systems under varying uncertain conditions, system
observability, and measurement quality.
