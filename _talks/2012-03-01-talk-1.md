This talk is about the approach of identifying overlapping events with a shallow convolutional neural network. The main challenges include the interactive impacts between events, and two strategies are proposed to reduce these effects: (1) A prediction-subtraction process is proposed to reduce the impacts from the previous event; (2) The raw time series are transformed into feature matrices to augment the robustness to variances of inputs. Then a two-path CNN is designed to classify the evnt one by one in real-time.
