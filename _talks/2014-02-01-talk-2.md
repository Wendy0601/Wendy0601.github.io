This 30-minute talk generalize the main ideas of extract features with physical meanings from the high-dimentional power grid datasets. The features can be applied to identify the type of events and locate variant faults in real-time. The low-rank and sparse property of the datasets are employed to define the features, and the dictionary, convolutional neural networks (CNN) are combined to achieve the identification and location tasks.
