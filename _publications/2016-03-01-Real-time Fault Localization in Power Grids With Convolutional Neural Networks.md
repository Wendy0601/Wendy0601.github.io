title: "Real-time Fault Localization in Power Grids With Convolutional Neural Networks"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2018-Oct-submitted
excerpt: 'Diverse fault types, fast re-closures and complicated
transient states after a fault event make real-time fault location
in power grids challenging. Existing localization techniques in
this area rely on simplistic assumptions, such as static loads, or
require much higher sampling rates or total measurement availability. This paper proposes a data-driven localization method
based on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifier using
bus voltages. Unlike prior data-driven methods, the proposed
classifier is based on features with physical interpretations that
are described in details. The accuracy of our CNN based
localization tool is demonstrably superior to other machine
learning classifiers in the literature. To further improve the
location performance, a novel phasor measurement units (PMU)
placement strategy is proposed and validated against other
methods. A significant aspect of our methodology is that under
very low observability (7% of buses), the algorithm is still able
to localize the faulted line to a small neighborhood with high
probability. The performance of our scheme is validated through
simulations of faults of various types in the IEEE 68-bus power
system under varying load conditions, system observability and
measurement quality.'
