## Abstract
The increasingly denser coverage of PMUs enables dynamic visibility into power systems. The large amounts of data obtained by PMUs impose significant challenges to data management and information extraction. The spatial-temporal blocks of PMU exhibit low-dimensional structures despite the high ambient dimensions. The low-dimensionality can be exploited to enable and simplify multiple PMU data management tasks under the same framework. This paper summarizes our recent results on data privacy enhancement, fast event identification, and further development of missing data recovery. Random noise and quantization are applied to the measurements before transmission to compress data and enhance data privacy. To maintain the data accuracy for the operator, we develop novel methods to recover the original data from quantized measurements even when partial measurements are corrupted. A real-time event identification method is also proposed, based on the new idea of characterizing an event by the low-dimensional subspace spanned by the dominant singular vectors of the data matrix. Additional structures in the PMU data besides low-rankness are exploited to enhance the accuracy of missing data recovery. All the methods are evaluated on synthetic and historical PMU datasets.
